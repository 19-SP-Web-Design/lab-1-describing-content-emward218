<p><em>Always keep in mind that camping spots are hard to find within camping resorts during the summer.</em>
Depending on the season, you might want to already be prepared to head out on your camping trip a day before the actual date set. </p>
<blockquote>Always look for other campsites for back up plans.
Before you go camping you must prepare by packing your clothes. Pack a pair of clothes for how many days that you will be gone. 
Do not forget you’ll need shorts for swimming, so pack those. A couple more things to consider is a sweat shirt for the nights that are cold. And a pair of pants for when the mosquitos get bad.</blockquote>
Next you will need to pack equipment for sleeping. <mark>Depending how many people that will be paired in a group at night totally depends on your tent size.</mark>

Pack plastic to lay on the ground in side your tent and a tarp to lay on the ground underneath your tent for when it rains. This will help keep you dry. 
<strong><div>Don’t forget <strong>you’re cooking equipment, bug spray, lawn chairs, axe, lighter for the fire and so on.</div>
